This smalll tic_tac_toe project is built as a part of small project assigned in journey of learning python.
the ui logic and loops are normal 
In this when we slect single player mode. Then i have tried to make such a model that it would never lose . But i am unable to get that .
However with this model everytime i can get an output based on previous moves that's fine. 
but my model neither block opponent victory nor secure its own victory . I hv got suggestion to write logic manully instead of running a algorithm. 
But I feel that by  doing this, if i lose one single case then the user on it ,face issue. so i hv choosen the path in which my model may give u path to lose but never fail to predict
there is also a persepective that write logic only to block and secure ur victory if it is comes to a single decisive position. 
But, i know that this game can end, in this one or two move, then even this logic can't catch.
and thinking of many such case bored me so i dorp this idea.
I think maybe after sometime when i grow , know more things , I can work again on it and can improve its logic to make it something that I really want it to be.
